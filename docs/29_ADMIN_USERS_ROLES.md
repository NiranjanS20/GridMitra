# WF-50 — TENANTS, USERS & ROLES

**Role / audience:** Admin / Auditor

## Shared visual language — apply to every page

Use the supplied renewable-energy references as the visual direction, not as literal copies.

- **Overall feel:** premium renewable-energy / climate-tech product, editorial rather than generic SaaS.
- **Palette:** deep forest green, muted teal, warm cream/off-white, charcoal, restrained lime/electric-green accents; amber/orange only for warning states.
- **Typography:** expressive editorial/display face for major headings + clean modern sans-serif for UI/data.
- **Surfaces:** warm cream content surfaces, deep-green section bands, generous whitespace, rounded cards, thin borders, soft shadows.
- **Photography/illustration:** renewable-energy landscapes, neighbourhoods, rooftops, solar, batteries, substations, people and utility infrastructure. Use large image crops with subtle overlays rather than tiny decorative thumbnails.
- **Charts:** clean, editorial charts with restrained gridlines and strong annotation. Avoid dashboard clutter.
- **Status:** never communicate state by colour alone; pair colour with labels/icons.
- **Motion:** subtle reveal, smooth transitions, gentle energy-flow animations. Avoid excessive particles/neon/glassmorphism.
- **Responsive:** desktop-first composition with deliberate mobile stacking; never simply shrink a desktop dashboard.
- **Trust:** observed / forecast / simulated must remain visually distinct throughout the product.

## Product-wide navigation rule

Every authenticated/product page should retain a consistent role-aware navigation shell. The active page is visually highlighted, and related pages are reachable without forcing the user back to the landing page.

Use contextual breadcrumbs where useful:

**Role → Current page → Detail / action**

Every detail drawer/modal must provide a clear close/return path. Actions that change state must preserve the user's current context.

## Source-of-truth interaction principle

Every page follows:

**GLANCE → EXPLAIN → EVIDENCE**

Tell me what is happening → tell me why → show me the data proving it.

Never replace plain-language meaning with raw model terminology.


Purpose: administer tenants, users and role-based access.

### Tenant table
Tenant / Status / Sites / Users

### Users table
Name / Email / Role / Tenant / Status / Last active

### Roles
- Resident
- Operator
- Board
- DISCOM Engineer
- DISCOM Analyst
- Admin
- Auditor
- Demo

### Permission rule
Role permissions must be visible **before assignment**.

### Connected behavior
Role determines which product journey/navigation is exposed:
Resident → WF-10–19
Operator → WF-20–27
Cooperative/Board → WF-30–32
DISCOM → WF-40–44
Admin/Auditor → WF-50–53

## Implementation notes

- Preserve the page ID (`WF-50`) in developer-facing route metadata.
- Use real data when available; otherwise use clearly labelled prototype/simulated data.
- Do not invent field results, prices, reliability improvements, or model performance.
- Keep the page visually consistent with WF-01 while adapting density to the user's role.
